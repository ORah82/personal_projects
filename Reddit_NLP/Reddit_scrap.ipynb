The marathon currently ends on “Red Means Stop” and immediately goes to “The Terrible Secret of Turtle Bay,” same as it has since debuting on the app.\\n\\nS7 premiered 7 months ago and wrapped up five months ago. There are zero episodes available on Hulu, despite 1-6 + specials (except From the Ladle to the Grave) being there, and the [as] app itself only offers S7E3-S7E6, a mere four episodes. \\n\\nWhy is S7 unavailable in its entirety without buying the season on Amazon? Who wants to own the episodes without commentary from DH and JP? I found it kinda odd, especially considering new episodes of most other shows seem to get added to their respective [as] marathons as they premiere and otherwise would be available on Hulu, including most of [as]’s other 2018 offerings.

The difference was that Devito’s character (Rusty) absorbed Arnie (JJ) in vitro. \\n\\nThe problem with this theory is that there wasn’t a JJ tumor in the Monarch. It could have been a side effect of the clone technology like the Monarch’s eyebrows (abnormal hair grow versus conjoined twin). This could be addressed if the Monarch is a later generation clone than the current Rusty.

       "2  I’ve had the marathon on in the background occasionally the past few days, and I noticed no new episodes are a part of the 24/7 marathon. The marathon currently ends on “Red Means Stop” and immediately goes to “The Terrible Secret of Turtle Bay,” same as it has since debuting on the app.\\n\\nS7 premiered 7 months ago and wrapped up five months ago. There are zero episodes available on Hulu, despite 1-6 + specials (except From the Ladle to the Grave) being there, and the [as] app itself only offers S7E3-S7E6, a mere four episodes. \\n\\nWhy is S7 unavailable in its entirety without buying the season on Amazon? Who wants to own the episodes without commentary from DH and JP? I found it kinda odd, especially considering new episodes of most other shows seem to get added to their respective [as] marathons as they premiere and otherwise would be available on Hulu, including most of [as]’s other 2018 offerings. Not to mention, it’s not like there’s a physical release of the season available yet                 \n",
       "3  I had an odd connect the dots style thought chain that lead me to venture brothers, as happens often enough. This time it was about 24 telling 21 that everything has a soul, but babies don't get a soul until they are one. As well as saying \"they are not quite souls, but that is the general idea\".\\n\\nIf plants have this pseudo soul, but babies don't, what if the \"soul\" is a being will to survive? I'll probably get some hot ELI5 style \"you are wrong and here is why\" in the comments, but consider this. \\n\\nPlants adapt, overcome, and adjust, despite not having any ability to think. They know how to get what they need, and will adapt in crazy ways to get it. We have carnivorous plants for crying out loud!\\n\\nNow, why don't babies have souls? Human babies don't really have much will to survive, or instincts. They really are basically a \"little crying pooing monster blob\" until they age enough. \\n\\nMany animals have instincts of some sort when they are born, buuut many others do not. Soul vs no soul. \\n\\n   \n",
       "4  I apologize if this has been covered/theorized before.\\n\\nDean, Rusty, and the Monarch are all clones of the same person. The original was a milkshake baby like in the movie “Twins” with Arnold and Danny Devito. The difference was that Devito’s character (Rusty) absorbed Arnie (JJ) in vitro. \\n\\nThe problem with this theory is that there wasn’t a JJ tumor in the Monarch. It could have been a side effect of the clone technology like the Monarch’s eyebrows (abnormal hair grow versus conjoined twin). This could be addressed if the Monarch is a later generation clone than the current Rusty. Jonas could have cloned the Monarch post plane crash thinking Venturion was going to retain his memories post bot makeover.\\n\\nI still haven’t figured out how Hank fits in. Also, the Helper bot that gave rise the this theory was red (a red herring-bot).                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Usually character like stan, peter from family guy and homer from the Simpsons are static, they always behave the same as if all the life lessons learned from the previous episodes were nonexistent but stan seems to have changed from a narcissistic douchebag thats self absorbed to a caring yet somehow childish character who still has his own agenda. He cared for roger, he cared sk much he offered to do his roles. He cared for jeff to get a job. So weird how he suddenly chabged, not complaining its just odd and hard to get used to after so many seasons of asshole stan we now got the actual dad stan   \n",
